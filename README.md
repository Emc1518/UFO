The first thing that a user sees when accessing the webpage is the title and background image. Then there is the paragraph that explains the goal of the page. Below that, there is a table that holds the data of UFO sightings. On the left hand side of the page there is a table where users can enter filters to see specific information on sightings. The data can be filterd by date, city, state, country, shape of object seen, duration of sighting and comments. 

The image below shows a search for shape of object. When the "filter table" button is clicked, the data is refined and the page 
displays sightings where the object seen is described as a triangle.

## Summary

This webpage looks great and provides a satisfactory way of storing and displaying UFO sighitng data while allowing users to filter the data. A drawback that this page has is that the data must be input into the database in order to have up-to-date information. 

It would be recommendable to add a component that allows the web page data to update without having to manually input new sighting information. Another way this page can be improved may be to allow for users to submit sighting information and have it be added to the data.
